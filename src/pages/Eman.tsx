            Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the tragic tale of Eman Fatima — the self-proclaimed "baddie", "princess", and "future CEO", who in reality is just a walking cringe compilation with a Wi-Fi connection.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="font-bold text-roast-accent">Let’s start with the basics:</span><br />
            She talks like she’s starring in a drama, but it’s giving season 35 of "Yap Yap Ki Duniya". Her mouth moves more than the Pakistani government in an election year — nonstop, loud, and full of nothing. If she ever goes quiet, people might think there's a national emergency.
          </p>
          <p>
            You ever seen someone so fake, even Barbie would feel insecure? That's Eman. She says things like “I’m not like other girls” while wearing the exact same cringe "I’m daddy’s princess" hoodie that AliExpress stopped selling in 2019 because it was too embarrassing. She calls herself classy, but her voice note game is like someone gargling cringe while reading Wattpad fanfiction out loud.
          </p>
          <p>
            And bro — her life goals? Marrying a rich guy, living in a mansion, and owning a pink Mercedes she can’t even reverse park. 💅 In reality, she’s failing harder than Internet Explorer trying to load a modern website. The only "bags" she’s securing are the ones under her eyes from staying up all night to stalk people’s stories.
          </p>
          <p>
            She enters the GC like it’s her stage. But nobody claps. Everyone just stares like,<br />
            <span className="italic text-white/80">"Why is this cursed energy here again?"</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s like someone gave a megaphone to an overconfident goat and taught it feminism through TikTok comments.
          </p>
          <p>
            And please — the “Papa ki princess” act? 😭 More like “Papa, please help me pass at least one test”. You can’t just wrap delusion in pink glitter and call it a personality. That’s not girlbossing, that’s girl-losting.
          </p>
          <p>
            She’s the kind of person who’ll say,<br />
            <span className="block italic text-xl text-roast-accent">🗣️ “I'm not toxic, people are just jealous of my vibe.”</span>
            <br />No, Eman. We’re not jealous.<br />We’re exhausted.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the worst part? She thinks everyone loves her. But let’s be honest — even the group’s mute button prays for mercy when she starts typing.
