                Shahan, bro... where do I even start? This guy walks around the GC like he's some mysterious villain from a Netflix series, but really, he's just a low-budget side character from a forgotten PTV drama. With that obese teddy bear as his DP, he thinks he's being "cute and ironic," but it screams, "Help, I peaked in 2014!" He's the kind of guy who fails the NET but still acts like a NET examiner.

                Misogynist to the core, yet trying so hard to be funny it hurts — not just emotionally, but physically painful to read his texts. His jokes? Funnier in his head than they'll ever be in the chat. The kind of guy who bullies others just to hide the fact that his confidence is held together by screenshots of people replying to him once.
              </p>
              <p className="text-white/80 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
                Calls himself "pure evil," but honestly? He's just pure embarrassment. Shahan, take a seat bro — actually no, you've already been sitting for too long doing nothing but spreading cringe in the chat.
