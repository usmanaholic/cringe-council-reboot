                Oh boy. Mehreen Api. You know how in every group, there's that one person who means well but somehow manages to carry the aura of a retired tiffin box? Yeah. That's her. That's Mehreen Api. The walking combination of lost dreams, overcooked biryani, and missed opportunities — all wrapped in a shawl of sadness and confusion.

              <p className="text-white/80 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
                Mehreen isn't just a person — she's a feeling. A whole vibe of defeat wrapped in a dupatta of "maybe next time." You see her sitting there quietly and think: "Aww, poor soul." Until she opens her mouth and drops some next-level cringe advice like: "Beta, keep trying... success is around the corner." Api, if success was around the corner, you'd have needed GPS, Google Maps, and a search party to find it by now.

                Mehreen's presence is like that one cow that stands in the middle of the road and refuses to move. She's not in your way intentionally, she's just… there. Existing. Breathing heavy. Looking like she's processing every betrayal since birth. And her footsteps? You hear them before you see her. "Dhap… dhap… dhap…"

            After all the roasts, all the failures, all the emotional damage, here's the truth: Mehreen Api is actually a Person. She may cry over NET results and overthink text replies, but she has a good heart. She's kind. She may not pass exams — but she passes the vibe check. She might be a walking disaster, but she's our disaster.
