                Eman out here acting like the silent supporter of Shahan's roast fest, as if being the sidekick of a villain makes you relevant. Girl, you failed the NET â€” instead of mocking people, maybe mock your own prep strategy.

              <p className="text-white/80 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
                Always lurking in the background, occasionally throwing shade like she's some GC mastermind. But guess what? You're just a faded watermark in the cringe document these people live in. She thinks staying lowkey makes her mysterious â€” no, it just makes you forgettable. Like background noise in a badly produced podcast.
              </p>
              <p className="text-white/80 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
                If Shahan is the main cringe, Eman is the echo. No identity, no originality â€” just a "me too" vibe floating in every roast that wasn't even about her. You've got the energy of someone who claps at the end of a movie no one liked. Honestly, her presence in the roast just makes it better â€” like seasoning on a plate of disaster.
