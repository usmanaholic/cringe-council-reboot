                Let's get it straight: We're not talking about Shanzay. No no. We're talking about SHAZANY — the living, breathing typo, the one whose name autocorrects itself out of shame.
              </p>
              <p className="text-white/80 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
                You know how every group chat has that one person who posts something, and you immediately clutch your soul in second-hand embarrassment? That's Shazany. She drops edits so outdated they look like they were made on Windows XP using MS Paint. Like fr, what are these?? Old wedding-style edits with pink glitter, 480p quality, and "forever queen" written in Urdu calligraphy?? Sis, are you making memories or PowerPoint trauma slides??
              </p>
              <p className="text-white/80 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
                And her singing career? LMAOOOO 🤣 Forget Coke Studio, she's straight outta Toilet Tunes Volume 3. Always humming stuff like "Maa Jan", "Mere Pyaray Papa" in full drama mode — like girl, this ain't a telefilm. You're not auditioning for Khatoon Digest – The Musical. Bathroom singing is fine — until it turns into a live concert no one asked for.

              <p className="text-white/80">
                She walks in with that "main celebrity hoon" vibe like she just met Malik Riaz and he gave her 1,000 rupees as if that's some award of honor. Sis, Malik Riaz tips his driver more than that. That's not a flex. That's an economic warning.
