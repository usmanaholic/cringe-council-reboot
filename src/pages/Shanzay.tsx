            <span className="font-bold text-roast-accent">Let’s get it straight:</span><br />
            We’re not talking about Shanzay.<br />
            <span className="ml-4">No no.</span><br />
            We’re talking about <span className="font-bold text-roast-accent">SHAZANY</span> — the living, breathing typo, the one whose name autocorrects itself out of shame 😬✍️
          </p>
          <p>
            You know how every group chat has that one person who posts something, and you immediately clutch your soul in second-hand embarrassment?<br />
            <span className="font-bold">That’s Shazany.</span><br />
            She drops edits so outdated they look like they were made on Windows XP using MS Paint.<br />
            Like fr, what are these??<br />
            Old wedding-style edits with pink glitter, 480p quality, and "forever queen" written in Urdu calligraphy??<br />
            Sis, are you making memories or PowerPoint trauma slides??
          </p>
          <p>
            And her singing career? <span className="font-bold text-roast-accent">LMAOOOO 🤣</span><br />
            Forget Coke Studio, she’s straight outta Toilet Tunes Volume 3.<br />
            Always humming stuff like “Maa Jan,” “Mere Pyaray Papa” in full drama mode — like girl, this ain’t a telefilm.<br />
            You’re not auditioning for Khatoon Digest – The Musical.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bathroom singing is fine — until it turns into a live concert no one asked for.<br />
            <span className="block mt-2 mb-2 text-2xl text-roast-accent">Shazany be like:</span>
            <span className="block italic text-xl text-white/80">🎤 “Maain terii maaaan hoooon…”</span>
            <span className="block text-white/70">Meanwhile, the bathroom tiles are praying for silence. 💀</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            And don’t even start on her personality.<br />
            She walks in with that “main celebrity hoon” vibe like she just met Malik Riaz and he gave her 1,000 rupees as if that’s some award of honor.<br />
            Sis, Malik Riaz tips his driver more than that.<br />
            That’s not a flex. That’s an economic warning.
          </p>
          <p>
            She’s always like:<br />
            <span className="italic">“I know so many celebrities 😏”</span><br />
            Like who??<br />
            That one actor from a Geo TV ad in 2011??<br />
            Her vibe is stuck between "wannabe TikTok star" and "overconfident auntie at mehndi."<br />
            Trying to sound classy while being peak cringecore.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the best part?<br />
            She <span className="font-bold text-roast-accent">HATES</span> when you spell her name wrong.<br />
            So <span className="font-bold text-roast-accent">SHAZANY</span> it is — engraved in HTML, CSS, and your downfall 💅<br />
            Deal with it, Your Highness Cringe.

            So, SHAZANY, the stage is yours…<br />
            But the mic?<br />
            Yeah, we unplugged it.<br />
            For everyone’s safety. 🔇🚫

            <p>
              Shanzay might be the Queen of Cringe in the roast realm, but in real life?<br />
              She's a topper through and through. Yeah, she might’ve fumbled the NET — but academically, she’s sharp as a tack and knows how to slay those grades.<br />
              And don’t even get me started on her cooking — Girl can whip up a daal that hits harder than a heartbreak playlist. 💔🍲
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              So while we joke, roast, and meme — just know this:<br />
              Shanzay’s got brains, vibes, and actual talent where it counts.<br />
              She’s cool, she’s kind (unless you're her prey in a roast), and yeah… she’s still slightly unbearable in the bathroom concerts. 😅
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 font-bold text-roast-accent text-xl">Peace out, Shazany. No hard feelings — only crispy ones. 🔥❤️</p>
